# Battleship

This is an app created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to play battleship vs the computer. The purpose of this project was to gain practice using TDD. There are unit tests covering the all the functionality of the Gameboard, Ship, and Player factory functions. Testing the UI was beyond the scope of this project, perhaps I will come back to this in the future however.
